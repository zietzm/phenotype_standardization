## IL-6 

This finds each person's first IL-6 measurement since March 01, 2020 using [LOINC 26881-3 (Interleukin 6 [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma)](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/3023091). 

There are a couple different tests in our data that use this code. The overwhelming majority are two tests with the same reference values (<=5), so I restrict to these.
