## C-reactive protein 

This finds each person's first C-reactive protein measurement since March 01, 2020 using either of the following measurements:

1. [LOINC 1988-5 (C reactive protein [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma)](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/3020460)
2. [LOINC 30522-7 (C reactive protein [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma by High sensitivity method)](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/3010156)

Since the measurements use both mg/dL and mg/L, this returns all values converted to **mg/L**.
