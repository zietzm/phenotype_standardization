## Diabetic neuropathy 

Using a single diagnosis of any descendant of [SNOMED CT 422088007 (Disorder of nervous system due to diabetes mellitus)](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/443730) or ICD-10 CM terms containing "neuropathy" within the ICD-10 CM diabetes mellitus range ([E08, E09, E10, E11, E13](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/E00-E89/E08-E13)). 

Note: there are a lot of ICD-10 CM codes describing diabetic neuropathy (22 used in the COVID table alone as of June 10), so I chose not to list them explicitly.
