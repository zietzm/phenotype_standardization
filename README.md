# Standardized phenotypes library

[![GitHub Actions Wiki CI](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/zietzm/phenotype_standardization/Update%20and%20publish%20wiki?label=Build%20Wiki&logo=github&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/zietzm/phenotype_standardization/actions)

See https://github.com/zietzm/phenotype_standardization/wiki for formatted phenotypes with explanations.

`.sql` files for each phenotype can be found in the repository folders.

Current definitions are specific to the Tatonetti lab database schema.
In the future we hope to add more OMOP definitions that would be more broadly applicable.
